## 문제 682번 Baseball Game(규칙에 맞는 야구게임하기)
### 문제<br>
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

An integer x.<br>
Record a new score of x.<br>
'+'.<br>
Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.<br>
'D'.<br>
Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.<br>
'C'.<br>
Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.<br>

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.<br> 
<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]<br>
Output: 30<br>
Explanation:<br>
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].<br>
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].<br>
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].<br>
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].<br>
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].<br>
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.<br><br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]<br>
Output: 27<br>
Explanation:<br>
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].<br>
"-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].<br>
"4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].<br>
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].<br>
"D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].<br>
"9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].<br>
"+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].<br>
"+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].<br>
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.<br><br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: ops = ["1","C"]<br>
Output: 0<br>
Explanation:<br>
"1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].<br>
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].<br>
Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.<br><br> 

Constraints:<br>
1 <= operations.length <= 1000<br>
operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or a string representing an integer in the range [-3 * 10^4, 3 * 10^4].<br>
For operation "+", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.<br>
For operations "C" and "D", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.<br><br>
