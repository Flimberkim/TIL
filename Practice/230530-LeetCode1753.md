## 문제 1753번 Maximum Score From Removing Stones(돌을 하나씩 제거하면서 최대 점수 만들기)
### 문제<br>
시간복잡도 : O(N), N은 a,b,c 중 가장 큰 수의 크기<br>
아이디어 : 먼저 주어진 수를 작은 순서대로 x,y,z에 저장한다. 점수를 최대한 많이 얻어야 하기 때문에, 가장 큰 수 z를 0으로 만드는 것을 기준으로 생각한다. 나머지 두 수 x,y의 합에 따라 조건에 맞는 연산을 진행하면서 점수를 저장한다.<br>

You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).

Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.<br><br> 

Example 1:<br>
Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6<br>
Output: 6<br>
Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:<br>
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)<br>
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)<br>
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.<br><br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6<br>
Output: 7<br>
Explanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:<br>
- Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)<br>
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)<br>
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)<br>
- Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)<br>
- Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)<br>
There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.<br><br>

Example 3:<br>
Input: a = 1, b = 8, c = 8<br>
Output: 8<br>
Explanation: One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they are empty.<br>
After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.<br><br>

Constraints:<br>
1 <= a, b, c <= 10^5<br><br>
